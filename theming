Wordpress

WordPress does include a few built-in sections in customizer. 
If you want to use any of the existing, built-in ones, you don't need to declare them with add_section(). 
Instead, refer to them by name. The following sections are built-in:

title_tagline - Site Title & Tagline (and Site Icon in WP 4.3+)
colors - Colors
header_image - Header Image
background_image - Background Image
nav - Navigation
static_front_page - Static Front Page
