npm consists of three distinct components:
a. the website
b. the Command Line Interface (CLI)
c. the registry
----
Use the website to discover packages, set up profiles, and manage other aspects of your npm experience. 
For example, you can set up Orgs (organizations) to manage access to public or private packages.
The CLI runs from a terminal, and is how most developers interact with npm.
The registry is a large public database of JavaScript software and the meta-information surrounding it.
----
Use npm to . . .
a. Adapt packages of code for your apps, or incorporate packages as they are.
b. Download standalone tools you can use right away.
c. Run packages without downloading using npx.
d. Share code with any npm user, anywhere.
e. Restrict code to specific developers.
f. Create Orgs (organizations) to coordinate package maintenance, coding, and developers.
g. Form virtual teams by using Orgs.
h. Manage multiple versions of code and code dependencies.
i. Update applications easily when underlying code is updated.
j. Discover multiple ways to solve the same puzzle.
k. Find other developers who are working on similar problems and projects.

To publish and install packages to and from the public npm registry or your companyâ€™s npm Enterprise registry, 
you must install Node.js and the npm command line interface using either a Node version manager or a Node installer.
To download the latest version of npm, on the command line, run the following command:
[sudo] npm install npm -g
